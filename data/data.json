Each quote has properties such as text, source, citation and date. In my code I utilized two functions to select a random quote and to print the random quote to the web page.

      "description": "I took a basic web form and used JavaScript to add interactivity and enhance usability, I incorporated live validators to check for correct information that gives immediate feedback to the user. I implemented a focus feature which placed the cursor in the first text field once the page is loaded. I also implemented live interactivity on the form based on the user's selection with the job role, t-shirt, total cost and payment sections. Validation also provides feedback to the user if they attempt to submit the form without it being complete. I used regex in my code to provide parameters for the credit card and zip code fields. My code involved conditionals, regular expressions and string manipulation. Click the Live Demo link to try out the form (please be advised that any information you submit will not be submitted anywhere as it is a demo form).",
