      "description": "I took a basic web form and used JavaScript to add interactivity and enhance usability, I incorporated live validators to check for correct information that gives immediate feedback to the user. I implemented a focus feature which placed the cursor in the first text field once the page is loaded. I also implemented live interactivity on the form based on the user's selection with the job role, t-shirt, total cost and payment sections. Validation also provides feedback to the user if they attempt to submit the form without it being complete. I also used regex in my code to provide parameters for the credit card and zip code fields. My code involved conditionals, regular expressions adn string manipulation.",
